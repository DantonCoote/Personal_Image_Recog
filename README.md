# Personal_Image_Recog
This is a refactoring of an old image recognition project I build as a side project during a break from the RRC.

This is a full restructuring of the project from my old system as I did not fully understand Image Classification at the time and the project was initially an experiment into basic image classification systems. With my current knowledge of Neural Networks I can likely make a custom model that will be more accurate in it's classicification and quite a bit more efficient. 
The Dataset I am using is publicaly available on Kaggle at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/larusso94/shark-species
